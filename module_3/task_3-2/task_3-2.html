      <li>[In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?]</li>
      <p>[ 
        Yes, it is often possible to solve a problem using a single for loop in JavaScript. Whether itâ€™s practical or efficient to do so 
        depends on the specific problem, but many tasks that might traditionally involve nested loops or multiple loops can be simplified to 
        a single loop with the right approach. For example use an if-else statement within the for loop, printOut both the count down and 
        count up. this is one of the many ways to solve this task. ]</p>
      <li>[In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop?
        Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. Provide a thorough explanation of
        your answer]</li>
      <p>[Yes, it is possible to create a "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop. This would occur if the condition is 
        always true, or a condition tha never fail, which causes the loop to run continuously without ever terminating. However, it's 
        important to note that infinite loops can have side effects, such as freezing your application or consuming excessive resources, so 
        they should be used intentionally and with caution. ]</p>
      <li>[Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the
        number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can
        the program perform other tasks concurrently?]</li>
      <p>[In part 2 there is less numbers to get the number 45, but here it is a lot more numbers, which will take a little more time for the
        for the computer to compute. Since the approach we take here is a random number between 1 and 1M, means that the target number will 
        take like around 500 000 random guesses to fined the correct number. not to mention that the program runs in a single threaded manner, 
        which means that it can only read one line at the time. The Date.now() is measuring the time taken during the guessing, and will show 
        how quickly the program performs the task, which will take a number of seconds or milliseconds. ]</p>
      <li>[Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance,
        change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not
        matter?]</li>
      <p>[In nested "for" loops, the relationship between rows and columns is defined by the order in which the loops are nested, which directly 
        affects how elements in a grid or matrix are accessed. How this works is that the outer loop iterates over rows and the inner loop 
        iterates over columns within each row. Changing the order generally does not affect functionality if each element is processed individually 
        without dependency on the processing order. However, if processing order matters (for example, if results depend on accessing items 
        row-by-row), you should keep rows as the outer loop and columns as the inner loop.]</p>
