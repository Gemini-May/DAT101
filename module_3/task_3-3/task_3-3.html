      <li>[What is the difference between invoking and creating a function?]</li>
      <p>[The difference between invoking and creating a function is that Invoking a function (or calling
         a function) is when you actually execute the function. This happens when you provide the function 
         name followed by parentheses, possibly passing arguments. And when you Creating a function means 
         defining it in your code. This is when you write the function's name, parameters, and body. It's 
         like making a recipe.]</p>
      <li>[Explain the syntax regarding semicolons and code blocks.]</li>
      <p>[Semicolons are used to terminate statements in JavaScript. They indicate the end of a logical unit 
        of code. However, JavaScript has automatic semicolon insertion (ASI), which means that semicolons 
        can often be omitted, but it's a best practice to use them explicitly. A code block is used to group 
        multiple statements, such as in if statements, loops, or functions. Code blocks don't need semicolons 
        between the statements inside them.]</p>
      <li>[3. What happens when we try to store values from a function when it doesn't return any?]</li>
      <p>[If a function doesnâ€™t return any value (i.e., it doesn't have a return statement), it returns 
        undefined by default.]</p>
      <li>[ How do we separate parameters from each other when creating a function?]</li>
      <p>[In JavaScript, parameters are separated by commas inside the parentheses when creating a function.]</p>
      <li>[Explain how parameter names are related during the invocation and creation of a function.]</li>
      <p>[The parameter names in the function definition are placeholders that represent the values passed 
        during the function invocation. During invocation, the value passed to the function replaces the 
        parameter name.]</p>
      <li>[Explain why a parameter is undefined when a function call is missing a parameter.]</li>
      <p>[If a function expects a parameter but you don't provide one during the invocation, the parameter 
        automatically gets the value undefined.]</p>
      <li>[Explain what happens when we use recursive functions.]</li>
      <p>[A recursive function is a function that calls itself. It is typically used to solve problems that 
        can be broken down into smaller subproblems. Each time the function calls itself, it reduces the 
        problem size until it reaches a base case (a stopping condition)]</p>
