      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[If there is a condition or a function checking whether the wake-up time is exactly 7 which here is "I can catch the bus to school", then any time that is not 7 will trigger a different behaviour.
        for example, if you put another number like 6 or 8, than it will trigger else.]</p>

      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[In part 2 the same behaviour as in part 1 will happened. but here we have expanded the if statement with else "I have to take the car to school". Which means that if wakeup-time is 
        other then 7, than I have to take the car instead. ]</p>

      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>[If the wakeup-time is less than 7 or greater than 8, than the program will give "I have to take the car to school", since 7 is "I can take the buss to school",
         and 8 is "I can take the traint to school".]</p>

      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p> [If the number is exactly "zero", it will just say number "zero". we have identified all numbers bellow "zero" is negative, and all numbers above "zero" is 
        positive, so in the program will not count with the number "zero" in either positive nor negative.]</p>
