      <li>[1. Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?]</li>
      <p>[Object-oriented development (OOD) is important in programming for several reasons like modularity, reusability, 
        abstraction, maintainability and scalability, inheritance and encapsulation. Modularity is about OOD encourages the division 
        of software into smaller, manageable, and reusable units (objects). Reusability is about Objects and classes can be reused 
        in different parts of a program or even across different programs. Abstraction is OOD allows for the hiding of complex 
        implementation details behind simple interfaces, making it easier to interact with complex systems. Maintainability and 
        Scalability is about OOD helps in organizing code in a way that is easy to update or extend. When it comes to inheritance 
        the Classes can inherit properties and methods from other classes, which facilitates code reuse and extension without 
        modifying existing code. This leads to more flexible systems.Encapsulation: By keeping data and methods that operate on the 
        data within a class, OOD ensures that objects are self-contained and their internal workings are protected from direct. 
        Encapsulation is By keeping data and methods that operate on the data within a class, OOD ensures that objects are self-
        contained and their internal workings are protected from direct external manipulation, increasing the reliability and security 
        of the system external manipulation, increasing the reliability and security of the system]</p>
      <li>[2. In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and
        how this type of object can help us in software development]</li>
      <p>[In Task 1, the "AccountType" static object is used to represent different types of bank accounts, such as "Normal," "Saving," 
        or "Pension." By creating a static object or a set of predefined constants. The use of such static objects improves consistency, 
        readability, and maintainability, helping developers avoid errors and make the code more flexible for future changes.]</p>
      <li>[3. Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class?
        Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function]</li>
      <p>[Encapsulation is the practice of hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only what is necessary through well-
        defined interfaces. This is an important concept in object-oriented development because it can protect object integrity by making 
        certain properties and methods private. Simplifies Interaction when only necessary methods (public methods) are exposed, the 
        interaction with the object becomes simpler and more controlled. Allows for changes without affecting Other Code.]</p>
      <li>[4. Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.]</li>
      <p>[In JavaScript, the new keyword is used to create an instance of a class (or constructor function). when "new" is used, the four 
        following steps occer. First a new objekt is created, then prototype Linkage, constructor function is called. and in the end it 
        will return the new object. ]</p>
