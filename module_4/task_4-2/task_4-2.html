      <li>[1. What is an array? A short and concise answer is expected here!]</li>
      <p>[An array is a data structure that holds a collection of values or elements, typically of the same 
        type, in a specific order. Each element can be accessed by its index or position in the array]</p>

      <li>[2. What does it mean to "hardcode" when we talk about programming? (In English, it's called "hard
        coding", "hard-coding", or "hardcoding")]</li>
      <p>[Hardcoding refers to embedding fixed values directly into the source code, rather than using 
        variables, constants, or input data. This makes the code inflexible and harder to maintain or update.]</p>

      <li>[3. Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we
        (humans) don't "know" how long the array is.]</li>
      <p>[In task 3, we use an array whose size may not be known in advance. To traverse or iterate through the 
        array, we use a loop (like for or forEach) that goes through each element one by one until the array is 
        fully processed. The loop continues until it reaches the end of the array, and we don't need to know the 
        exact length beforehand.]</p>

      <li>4. Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4?]</li>
      <p>[Storing instances of a class in an array allows us to manage multiple objects more easily. It enables 
        operations like iterating over all objects, grouping related data, and performing bulk updates or actions 
        on those instances efficiently, reducing code complexity.]</p>

      <li>[5. Try your best to explain the EWeekDays object from task 7. How do we use the "value" attribute, for
        example? In what way do "WeekDay", "Workdays", and "Weekends" differ from each other? If we
        wanted to create a new element "WorkoutDays", which would contain "Monday", "Wednesday", and
        "Thursday", how would it ideally look? (I will choose the best answer to this task and reward it with
        pizza in the cafeteria right after New Year. Remember to mark in your submission if you want to
        participate in the competition!)]</li>
      <p>[The EWeekDays object represents days of the week and their associated values. The "value" attribute holds 
        a unique bitmask or numeric value that represents each day or category (like weekdays or weekends).]</p>

      <li>[6. In task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" routine works]</li>
      <p>[A callback routine is a function passed as an argument to another function. In sorting, the callback is 
        used to compare two elements at a time to determine their order. The callback function returns, a negative 
        value, a positive value and zero, if both elements are considered equal in terms of sorting order. ]</p>

      <li>[7. What happens in the sorting routines you have created? Try to explain how the array can figure out
        if an element should come before or after another. The best way to answer this is to actually print
        both parameters each time the sorting routine runs.]</li>
      <p>[In sorting, we compare two elements at a time using a callback function. The array iterates through each 
        pair of elements, comparing them using the callback. The comparison helps determine whether the first 
        element should be ordered before or after the second. We can print both elements during each comparison to 
        see how they are evaluated and swapped if necessary.]</p>

      <li>[8. In task 10, we will create an array with rows and columns. Explain what the first element of the array
        contains.]</li>
      <p>[In a 2D array (array with rows and columns), the first element typically refers to the first row, which is 
        an array of elements. Each subsequent element in the array corresponds to a row, and each row contains 
        multiple columns (elements).]</p>
